## About

This repository contains examples of common design patterns found in Zig's standard library and many community projects. I hope that these examples will help people new to the language gain an understanding of the many ways one can structure their programs in Zig, as well as why Zig does not prescribe a certain way to do "interfaces."

## Examples

### `anytype`

`zig build anytype`

### `@fieldParentPtr`

`zig build field_parent_ptr`

![field parent ptr](.github/assets/field_parent_ptr.svg)

### `vtable`

`zig build vtable`
